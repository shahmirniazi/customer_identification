# Customer Identification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains Python code for building machine learning models to help a bank identify customers with the highest potential to accept long-term deposit offers.

## Overview

The project uses various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Python scripts in your preferred environment or Jupyter Notebook to execute the machine learning models and analyze the results.

## Data

The data used for training and testing the models is stored in the `bank-additional-full.csv` file. 

## Models

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**

## Scoring Mechanism

The scoring mechanism used evaluates each model based on a set of predefined parameters.

## Results

After optimization, Gradient Boosting Machines turned out to be the best performing machine learning model, followed by Decision Trees.
